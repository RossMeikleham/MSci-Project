\section{Project Plan}

Figure~\ref{flow} shows the overview of the proposed framework.

The steps to create the planned framework are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the EDSL, which encapsulates the vector type transformations, supports
      a rudimentary cost model, as well as including variants for describing how to parallelize
      maps and folds. 

\item Implement the ability to interpret the EDSL from Idris, this can
      be helpful for testing while creating the framework, as well as for
      testing programs before converting them onto a FPGA.

\item Implement generating all possible program variants from a given program,
      if possible use Idris with the vector type transformation properties to prove
      that variants will always generate the same results as the original program.

\item Implement a flexible interface for exporting the EDSL into IR formats.
\end{itemize}

After the framework implementation we plan to create some non trivial programs 
to demonstrate how the framework can be feasibly used for generating efficient programs.
