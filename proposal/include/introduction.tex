Idris is a depdendently types programming language.
Essentially types are a first class language construct.

Define types with size e.g. a list with size

```
Data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type
Nil : Vect 0 a
(::) : a -> Vect n a -> Vect (n + 1) a
```

We define a function `fn` which takes a Vector of size
n, and returns a type Vector of size n + 1 as follows:

fn : Vect n a -> Vect (n + 1) a

At compile time Idris enforces that the Vector returned must
contain exactly 1 element more than the Vector passed in.
