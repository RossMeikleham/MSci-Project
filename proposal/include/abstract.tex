\section{Abstract}
In the past scientific Fortran code was mainly written sequentially; programmers 
could rely on faster processors being produced in the future which would in turn result in a 
speedup of these programs. However, in the past decade processor speeds have started
to stagnate. These scientific programs typically have a large amount of data parallelism that is 
able to be exploited. This can result in very large performance gains when converted to run 
on heterogeneous platforms such as FPGAs or GPUs. However this typically requires heavy modification of older code, 
and in-depth knowledge of parallel programming. This project focuses on exploring type transformations with 
dependent types to automatically generate correct by construction program variants, and selecting
one of these variants which results in the "best" results with respect to a given cost model.
