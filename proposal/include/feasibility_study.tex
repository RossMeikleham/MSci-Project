\section{Feasibility Study}


We define the Shape of a Vector as
an Idris Vect of given number dimensions


We use this shape to define the Vector type,
this follows the defintion from [] as a 0 dimensional
Vector of type t is simply a single variable of type t.

\subsection{Vector Functions}


From our Vector definition it's trivial to define the singleton function
as a function taking a 0 dimensional vector and mapping it to a 1 dimensional
vector, as well as it's inverse function as follows:

\inputIdrisListing{code/singleton.idr}


Taking a given Vector which has 2 or more dimensions, we can decrease 
the dimensionality by 1 by concatonating all the Sub-Vectors as follows
\inputIdrisListing{code/redDim.idr}
This results in a Vector with a dimensionality of one less than the input Vector,
with the same elements as the input Vector, where ordering is
also preserved. 


Taking a given Vector which has 1 or more dimensions, in which the most "outer" dimension is
made up of n * m elements, where n, m $\in \mathbb{N}$; we can increase the dimensionality of
the given Vector by 1 by splitting the Vector at each n Sub-Vectors which results in m lots of
n sub vectors.
